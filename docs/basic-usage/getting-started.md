To get started, we recommend reading these sections first:

- [Configuring your first server type](/docs/laravel-dynamic-servers/v1/basic-usage/configuring-your-first-server-type)
- [Ensuring a number of servers](/docs/laravel-dynamic-servers/v1/basic-usage/ensuring-a-number-of-servers)

After that, you can start exploring the rest of the docs.
